pycones-docker
==============


This is the material that we're going to use during the Docker workshop at PyConEs 2014.

If you are interested on following the workshop with your computer, you will need to have a version of docker (or boot2docker if you don't use Linux). Besides docker, it would be really appreciated if you could cache as many images as possible to reduce the network traffic during the Workshop.

To do so, you can execute the [setup.sh](https://github.com/ipedrazas/pycones-docker/blob/master/setup.sh) script

There's another file [dockersh.rc](https://github.com/ipedrazas/pycones-docker/blob/master/dockersh.rc) that containes a few aliases and functions to make easier working with docker
